# Godot Save and Load System
A simple demonstration of how saving and loading is implemented in Godot (4+). There are many methods that can be used to save and load data in Godot, but this project only uses [Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_resource.html) (.tres) or [ConfigFile](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_configfile.html) (.ini) to save certain variables.
